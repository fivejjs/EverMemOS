# Demo - EverMemOS Interactive Examples

[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README_zh.md)

This directory contains interactive demos showcasing the core functionality of EverMemOS.

## 📂 Contents

### Core Demo Scripts

- **`extract_memory.py`** - Memory extraction from conversation data
  - Processes conversation files from the `data/` directory
  - Extracts MemCells and generates user profiles
  - Saves results to configured database (MongoDB) and local outputs

- **`chat_with_memory.py`** - Interactive chat with memory-enhanced AI
  - Command-line interface for conversing with AI agents
  - Leverages extracted memories for context-aware responses
  - Demonstrates end-to-end memory retrieval and usage

### Configuration Files

- **`memory_config.py`** - Memory system configuration
- **`memory_utils.py`** - Utility functions for memory operations
- **`i18n_texts.py`** - Internationalization text resources

### Output Directory

- **`chat_history/`** - Saved chat conversation logs
- **`memcell_outputs/`** - Extracted MemCell outputs (auto-generated)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Extract Memories

First, extract memories from sample conversation data:

```bash
uv run python src/bootstrap.py demo/extract_memory.py
```

This will:
- Read conversation data from `data/` directory
- Extract MemCells using LLM
- Generate user profiles
- Store in MongoDB and save to local files

### 2. Chat with Memory

After extraction, start an interactive chat session:

```bash
uv run python src/bootstrap.py demo/chat_with_memory.py
```

Features:
- Real-time conversation with AI
- Automatic memory retrieval based on context
- Bilingual support (English/Chinese)
- Chat history auto-save

## 📝 Usage Tips

### Memory Extraction

The extraction script processes JSON files in the `data/` directory (configured in `ExtractModeConfig` in `memory_config.py`). Ensure your conversation files follow the [GroupChatFormat](../data_format/group_chat/group_chat_format.md) specification. For convenience, we provide sample data files [group_chat.json](../data/group_chat.json) and [assistant_chat.json](../data/assistant_chat.json) for quick start. See the [data documentation](../data/README.md) for details.

### Interactive Chat

During chat sessions:
- Type naturally to converse with the AI
- The system automatically retrieves relevant memories
- Use `exit` to end the session
- Chat history is saved automatically (defaults to loading previous 5 messages as context)

## 🔧 Configuration

Edit `memory_config.py` to customize:
- LLM model selection
- Memory extraction parameters
- Database connection settings
- Output directories

## 📊 Example Output

After running `extract_memory.py`, you'll find:

```
demo/memcell_outputs/
├── user_profiles/
│   ├── user_101_profile.json
│   └── user_102_profile.json
